# OCLP-Mod Update Shim

To handle the new PKG installation method, old versions of OCLP-Mod updating to newer versions will still require 'OCLP-Mod.app' to be available for download.

Thus the goal of this app is to install an embedded PKG under ./OCLP-Mod.app/Contents/Resources/OCLP-Mod.pkg to handle the update process.
